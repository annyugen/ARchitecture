# ARchitecture
*ARchitecture* is an iOS mobile application that utilizes ARKit development platform to create augmented reality experience by displaying architectural 3D models  into the real world.

## Getting Started
If you are interested in developing *ARchitecture*, I recommend that you already had a basic understanding of Xcode, Swift, and ARKit. If not, check 'Built With' section below to learn more. 

### Prerequisites
Software requirement:
* Xcode (preferably with the latest version)
* ARKit (comes with the latest verion of Xcode)
Hardware requirement: 
* iPhone Devices: iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPhone 7, Iphone 7 Plus, iPhone 6s, Iphone 6s Plus, iPhone SE, iPhone 6.
* iPad Devices: iPad Pro (12.9-inch), iPad Pro (9.7-inch), iPad Pro 12.9-inch (2nd generation), iPad (5th generation).
**Note: *ARchitecture* is currently using ARKit 1.5 which will require the iOS firmware version to be 11.3+ to run. **


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

- Clone the respository using ```https://github.com/nguyenAn1201/ARchitecture.git``` or ```Download ZIP file```.
- Run Xcode and open the project.
- Change the provisoning profile that corresponds with the developer's Apple Account.
- Hit 'run' to build the app. 

## Deployment
Apple requires their developer to subcribe to their Apple Developer Program in order to deploy the app. There is currently no plan to deploy *ARchitecture* to AppStore.

## Built With
* [ARKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit) - Apple's augmented reality development platform for iOS devices.
* [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) - *ARchitecture* is a iOS mobile app so it's built by Xcode.
* [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) - All Xcode codes are written in Swift.
* [Free3D](https://free3d.com/) - Website that shares 3D models.
